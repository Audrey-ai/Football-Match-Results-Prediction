# Football-Match-Results-Prediction

This aim of this project is to predict the result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (rank should be included in training).

# Description
The use of advanced big data analytic in soccer starts showing its potential, however, sports analytics as a research area is still only emerging. Some of the problems are well-defined, e.g. many studies have attempted to predict the result of soccer matches before the match actually started.

In our research, we take a complementary perspective. We consider the use of predictive modeling to explain the outcome of a match based on the available data from the match (rather than trying to predict the outcome of the game before the game starts).The two main approaches to achieve this would be by use of Polynomial and Logistic regression algorithms and we will conduct cross validation and number of tests on our model such as Barlett's test.

# Setup/Installation Requirements
All you need to run this code is a browser with access to Google CoLab or alternatively Jupyter Notebook can be used.Both tools are for data preparation and analysis. For data manipulation the Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn, scipy and Sklearn libraries should be imported.
